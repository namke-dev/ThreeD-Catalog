      <h1>App Policy for Google Authentication</h1>

      <h2>Effective Date: 01 Jan, 2025</h2>

      <h3>1. Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Thank you for choosing D3-Catalog. This document outlines our policy
        regarding the use of Google Authentication in our application. By using
        the App, you agree to comply with this policy.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Google Authentication</h3>
      <p>
        The App utilizes Google Authentication to enhance security and provide a
        seamless login experience. When you choose to log in using your Google
        account, the App may access certain information from your Google
        profile, including but not limited to your name, email address, and
        profile picture. This information is used solely for the purpose of
        authentication and personalizing your experience within the App.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
      <h4>3.1 Information Collected:</h4>
      <p>
        The App collects basic information from your Google profile to create
        and manage your account within the App.
      </p>

      <h4>3.2 Purpose of Data Usage:</h4>
      <p>
        The collected information is used for user authentication and
        personalization of the App's features. Your email address may be used to
        communicate important updates, account-related information, and
        promotional materials. You can opt-out of promotional emails at any
        time.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Security Measures</h3>
      <h4>4.1 Data Security:</h4>
      <p>
        We prioritize the security of your information and have implemented
        industry-standard measures to safeguard it against unauthorized access,
        disclosure, or alteration.
      </p>

      <h4>4.2 Third-Party Security:</h4>
      <p>
        Google Authentication is a secure and trusted method. We do not store
        your Google login credentials; authentication is handled directly by
        Google.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
      <h4>5.1 Third-Party Access:</h4>
      <p>

        parties without your consent.

      <h3>6. User Controls</h3>
      <h4>6.1 Data Access and Deletion:</h4>
      <p>
        You can review, edit, or delete the information collected by accessing
        your account settings within the App.
